<p style="font-size: 16px; font-family: sans-serif">Eloheh Healthcare is a company founded with the mission of providing the highest-quality medical products and patient service to our distributors and customers. We never compromise on our offerings, because we believe healthcare shouldn’t cut corners. Our five founders came together to launch the company after facing disappointments from ineffective medical equipment, misdiagnoses from outdated machinery, and faulty tools that worsened injuries. Experiencing these frustrations led our team of founders to start a business that strives to enhance the reliability, accuracy, and comfort of healthcare. They immediately set about to find leading experts in medicine, engineering, and patient support to make their dream to re-invent healthcare a reality.
<br>
<br>
Eloheh’s first product was an innovative boot for patients recovering from an ankle injury. Our team supplied the first product to a college student being treated for a fractured ankle at <a href="https://www.franciscanhealth.org/find-a-location/franciscan-health-lafayette-218241" target= "_blank">Franciscan Health</a> in West Lafayette, Indiana.In addition to supporting the foot and reducing pressure to allow the bone to heal, our engineers incorporated an internal system to monitor the bone and tissue. It would record this information and could display it on any smart device along with recommendations for the patient to speed up the healing process.
<br>
<br>
This boot was an immediate success, and the business grew from there. Now, Eloheh’s team is working on more powerful X-Ray machines that emit half the radiation of current devices. With locations in all 50 states and 12 countries, doctors and patients everywhere are turning to Eloheh. Our new <a href= "elohehleadership.pdf" target="_blank">leadership team</a> is ready to carry our founders' vision to a brighter tomorrow. </p>
