<p style="font-size: 24px; font-family:'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><font color = teal>Our Story</font></p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">I just returned from studying abroad in Barcelona, Spain, where so many things were so new to me. I went from hearing English everywhere I went to conversing with cashiers, waiters, and coworkers in Spanish. Another big difference was living in a home with no air conditioning. Spain had a major heat wave a few weeks ago and instead of turning on the AC we relied on a ton of fans. Even something so small as buying groceries was totally different, too. Instead of one big store like Walmart that had food, a pharmacy, kitchenware, and clothes, in Spain you had to go to a different, smaller store for each type of item you needed. At first I felt overwhelmed with the new changes and I felt so out of place. Every time I spoke with a local I knew I stuck out like a sore thumb with my poor accent, and I was frustrated with how long it took to run errands. And adjusting to the heat was tough! But with time everything began to feel like a new “normal” and I even got used to not having air conditioning (kind of)! NOW I'm going to test out hyperlinks to make sure I can implement on when the time comes. <a href= "https://www.franciscanhealth.org/find-a-location/franciscan-health-lafayette-218241" target= "_blank">Franciscan Health</a> is just one hospital that's thriving thanks to Eloheh's high-quality healthcare products.
